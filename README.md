## 1. Accessing Swagger UI

Open your browser and go to the deployed Swagger UI link:
```
    https://belajarlinkedin-backend-assessment-production.up.railway.app
```

- You will see an interactive interface listing all available endpoints.
- You can **expand each endpoint**, see its parameters, try requests, and view responses.

## 2. Authorizing Requests (Login)

Some endpoints require authentication using **OAuth2 password flow (Bearer token)**.

### Steps to authorize:

1. Click the **Authorize** button at the top-right corner of Swagger UI.  
2. In the modal, enter your username and login
3. Click **Authorize** and close the modal.  
4. All authorized endpoints will now include your token automatically.

## 3. Admin-Only Endpoints

Some routes require **admin privileges** to access.  

- The default admin account is:
```
    username: admin
    password: admin
```
- Only users with `level="admin"` can perform actions like **adding, editing, or deleting classes**.  
- Attempting to access admin-only routes with a non-admin account will return a **403 Forbidden** error.
